# odin-recipes

## Project introduction

First skeleton project from TOP with **recipes** as the theme; This project is to ensure the first basics of HTML and Git are understood.

## Project skills use case

### Basic HTML tags (links, images, and texts)

This project showcases how to use simple HTML to create a simple recipe page linking from one page to another using the anchor tag `<a>`, inputting images using the `<img>` tag, and the `alt` attribute for an alternative title of the given image.

For texts, two types of headings were experimented with in this project: `<h1>` for the titles and `<h2>` for sub-titles like **Description**, **Ingredients**, and **Steps** for the recipes given in the project.

`<p>` tags were useful for the recipe descriptions.

### Basic HTML tags (listing)

Lists were important in this project to list the ingredients and the steps to take for specific types of recipes. The main types of lists used are:

- `<ol>`: For ordered listing
- `<ul>`: For unordered listing
